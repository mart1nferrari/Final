                Chatbox is a place dedicated to talking and hanging out with your friends, family and communities. Millions of diverse communities are on Chatbox, from small groups of old friends to huge servers where hundreds of thousands of people can connect over shared interests.

            <h1>PRINCIPLES</h1>
            <p>We want to make sure that Chatbox has the ability for everyone to have a safe, positive and inclusive experience, no matter what brought them here. For that to happen, we must all agree to a set of rules that govern our interactions on Chatbox. When you sign up to Chatbox, you agree to follow the rules below and refrain from behavior that isn’t allowed on the service.
            </p>
            <p>In exchange, it’s our job to make sure your experience is everything it can be. Here are the principles that guide the society we want to create on Chatbox:</p>

                We’re determined to make sure that Chatbox will always be a welcoming place for you.
            </h1>

            <p>
                There’s a huge responsibility in being a place where hundreds of millions of people talk to each other.

            <p>
                We do not monitor every server or every conversation. We do not sell your data, nor do we share it with third parties for advertising purposes.

            <p>
                We don’t sit back and simply wait for reports, but instead act to protect everyone on the platform. We know that there are cases where bad actors are acting to cause violence or harm in the real world, and we make it clear to them that there’s no place for them on Discord.

            <p>
                Your account on Chatbox doesn’t have to be tied back to your identity, and we want to make sure that everyone can be their true self. But that doesn’t mean that someone can be free of the consequences of their actions.
